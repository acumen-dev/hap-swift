# hap-swift

A native Swift implementation of the [HomeKit Accessory Protocol (HAP)](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/) — the TCP-based protocol Apple Home uses for SecuritySystem, GarageDoorOpener, and other device types that Matter does not support.

## Overview

Matter (spec 1.0–1.5) has no SecuritySystem or GarageDoorOpener device type. HAP fills that gap, letting Acumen advertise security panels and garage doors to Apple Home alongside Matter devices on the same network.

Both HAP and Matter use mDNS/DNS-SD for discovery via the shared [`mdns-swift`](https://github.com/acumen-dev/mdns-swift) package. HAP uses TCP transport; Matter uses UDP — the transport layers are separate.

## Module Architecture

```
HAPCore          — HAP types, TLV8, constants, service/characteristic definitions
    ↑
HAPCrypto        — SRP-6a (3072-bit), Curve25519, ChaCha20-Poly1305, HKDF-SHA512
    ↑
HAPTransport     — TCP server, pairing state machine, encrypted sessions, characteristic protocol
    ↑
├── HAPApple     — Network.framework TCP + MDNSApple  (Apple platforms)
└── HAPLinux     — SwiftNIO TCP + MDNSLinux            (Linux)

HAPSwift         — Umbrella re-export
```

## Usage

```swift
import HAPSwift

// Create a SecuritySystem accessory
let accessory = HAPAccessory(
    info: AccessoryInfo(
        name: "Front Panel",
        manufacturer: "Acumen",
        model: "SecuritySystem",
        serialNumber: "001",
        firmwareVersion: "1.0"
    ),
    category: .securitySystem,
    services: [securitySystemService]
)

// Advertise and serve via HAP
let bridge = HAPBridge(setupCode: "031-45-154")
bridge.addAccessory(accessory)
try await bridge.start()
```
